##Description

I refactored the code to be semantic, well structured, accessible, have sequential headings, have a descriptive title, and be more efficient and DRY.

I am learning to make code semantic, well structured, accessible, and descriptive. I have completed this challenge in order to learn better.

This project is practice for writing my own code, to better structure it according to best practices for semantics and accessibility.

Doing this project taught me some new HTML code, and some new CSS features. I learned how to use the display, margin, padding, float, and list style type tags in new ways, which was exciting! I have gotten much more used to Git Bash through this project. I learned to navigate and use my command terminal much more effectively. I also found that putting my notes in the comments after practicing and learning new code was very helpful for me to remember everything I learned, and explaining what I changed will make it easier to come back to this code, or for other devs to see what I did.

I followed the user story and acceptance criteria from the DU coding bootcamp.
